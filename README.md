# Social Media Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview  
The **Social Media Sentiment Analysis** project aims to analyze user sentiments from platforms like **Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram**. Using **Python and SQL**, we process, clean, and analyze social media data to extract insights on trending hashtags, user engagement, and sentiment distribution across platforms.

## Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess social media sentiment data.  
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key trends.  
- Identify the most liked platforms, popular hashtags, and sentiment distribution.  
- Analyze sentiment variations across different platforms and countries.  

## Methodology  

### 1. Data Collection  
- Imported a sentiment dataset from a **CSV file**.  

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Removed unnecessary columns.  
- Handled missing values.  
- Standardized text fields for consistency.  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Extracted **day, month, and year** from timestamps for trend analysis.  

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identified **top sentiments**, **popular platforms**, and **most used hashtags**.  
- Analyzed **user engagement metrics** (likes and retweets).  
- Segmented data by **platform** (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) for in-depth insights.  

### 5. Data Visualization  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** were used to create:  
  - **Bar plots** for sentiment distribution.  
  - **Pie charts** for platform-wise engagement.  
  - **Line graphs** for trend analysis over time.  

## Key Insights  
- **Most Retweeted Hashtags**: Identified the top 10 hashtags with the highest retweets.  
- **User Engagement**: Twitter had the highest retweets, while Instagram dominated in likes.  
- **Platform Distribution**: Each platform exhibited unique sentiment patterns.  
- **Geographic Trends**: Identified countries with the highest number of liked social media posts.  

## Files Used  
- **`sentimentdataset.csv`** - Raw dataset containing social media sentiments.  
- **`social_media_analysis.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook with data processing and analysis.  
- **`README.md`** - Project documentation (this file).  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and manipulation.  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualizations.  
- **SQL** for querying and analyzing structured data.  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for executing and documenting the analysis.  

## Conclusion  
This project provides **valuable insights** into social media sentiment trends, helping organizations understand **user engagement** and optimize their strategies accordingly.  

### Future Enhancements  
- Implement **machine learning models** for advanced sentiment classification.  
- Perform **real-time sentiment tracking** using APIs.  
- Expand analysis to include **more social media platforms**.
